'Greet Flood' is a mobile app with enhanced interactivity for demonstrating natural and nature-based solutions of flood management. NBS is much less popular among the public due to minimal awareness and available examples, resulting in a lack of understanding and admiration among the public. To bridge this knowledge gap, the 'Greet Flood' app is being developed with access to information of many demonstration sites around the world, featuring virtual video tours and augmented reality-based live tours.
