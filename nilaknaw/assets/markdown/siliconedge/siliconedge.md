# 24 Hours. No Internet. Just Pure Electronics.

_April 18, 2025_

**A true test of skill, fundamentals, and teamwork!**
Ever tried designing a waveform generator from scratch—with zero simulations, no internet, just pen, paper, a few resistors, and capacitors? That’s exactly what our team set out to do during a 24-hour analog electronics design competition.

The challenge was to build a fully functional waveform generator using only basic components and meet the given specifications. It was all about hands-on problem-solving: calculations on paper, circuits on breadboard, and endless rounds of debugging. After 24 intense hours, we had a nearly perfect working circuit! Though our approach didn’t quite align with the judging criteria, the experience was priceless.

This challenge made us lean solely on our fundamentals with no software tools but pure analog intuition. Teamwork made the true experience, splitting up tasks, debating approaches, and celebrating every small win. We may not have won the competition, but the real reward was to have a working design built from scratch and a deeper understanding of analog design.

Huge shoutout to my teammates Muftee and Kavishka for the late-night circuit debugging and non-stop laughs. 


Experiences like these remind me why I fell in love with electronics in the first place. There’s always something magical about hands-on electronics.
