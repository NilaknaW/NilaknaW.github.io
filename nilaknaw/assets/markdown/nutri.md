 _Electronic Product Development, Embedded Systems, Software development_ 

 A mobile app to assist with potion control and calorie intake by providing recommended food volumes of your meal and tools for potion control.

 Smart meal box with volume marking for volume control that comes with a scale that alerts recommended food amount.

 ⚒️ My contributions:
