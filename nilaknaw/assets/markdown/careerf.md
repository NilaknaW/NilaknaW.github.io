# Career fair web app 

As one of the web designers of the Electronic Club, this was one of the major projects I have worked on so far‚Äìdeveloping the web application for the official career fair of our department, ENTC. The web app serves as a comprehensive platform for students to showcase their profiles and for companies to register their organizations, explore student profiles, and access supporting resources.

**‚≠ê Highlights:** 
* User-friendly interface for all users: students and organizations.
* Responsive design for optimal usability across devices.
* Real-time updates for schedule changes and announcements.

**‚öíÔ∏è Technology Stack:**
* Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
* Backend: Firebase
* Hosting: Firebase
* Version Control: Git
