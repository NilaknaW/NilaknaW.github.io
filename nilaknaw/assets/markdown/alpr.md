# Automatic Licence Plate Recognition with YOLOv8 and OpenCV for Sri Lankan License Plate Recognition

The Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) project aims to develop a computer vision-based
solution for recognizing Sri Lankan license plates in real-time video from an IP camera. This project
utilizes Python and various computer vision libraries to implement a robust ALPR system.


## Project Overview
### 1. Objectives
1. Design and implement a system capable of detecting license plates on vehicles in images and videos.
2. Extract the license plate number of the vehicle from recognized license plates.
3. Achieve real-time processing for video streams from IP cameras.
4. Implement a user-friendly web interface for interaction with the ALPR system.

### 2. Technologies Used
* Python programming language.
* OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library.
* Ultralytics YOLOv8 object detection model.
* Training data set from Roboflow.
* EasyOCR (Optical Character Recognition).
* SORT (simple, online, and real-time tracking) module.
* Flask web framework.
* HTML and CSS scripting languages.
